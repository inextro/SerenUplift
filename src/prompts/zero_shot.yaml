    Serendipity means an unexpected but relevant discovery to a user.
    Being serendipity means being both unexpected and relevant.
    In recommendation tasks, being unexpected means the items are unlikely to be recommended to a user given this user's history.
    Meanwhile, being relevant means the items are closely related to a user's history.
    Given a user's history, please rate the serendipity of a candidate movie to the user. You need to consider both the unexpectedness and relevance aspects.

    Please provide a serendipity rating using a 5-point Likert scale:
    1- "strongly disagree"
    2 - "disagree"
    3 - "neither agree nor disagree"
    4 - "agree"
    5 - "strongly agree"

    Generate only the rating, and do not include any additional language before or after the rating.
