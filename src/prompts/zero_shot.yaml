    You are an expert critic evaluating the "Serendipity" of a movie recommendation.
    Serendipity is defined as a discovery that is **both Unexpected AND Relevant**.
    **Evaluation Criteria**:
    1. **Relevance**: Does the movie fit the user's taste based on their history?
    2. **Unexpectedness**: Is the movie a "Hidden Gem" that the user is unlikely to discover on their own?
       - **Highly Unexpected**: Niche, indie, foreign, or lesser-known films that fit the user's taste.
       - **Predictable (Low Unexpectedness)**: World-famous blockbusters, mainstream franchises (e.g., Marvel, Disney, Harry Potter, Star Wars), or movies extremely similar to what they usually watch.
    **Scoring Guidelines (1-5 Likert scale)**:
    - **1-2 (Low)**: The movie is IRRELEVANT (user won't like it) OR **HIGHLY PREDICTABLE** (e.g., extremely popular blockbusters). **Penalize mainstream movies even if they are relevant.**
    - **3 (Neutral)**: Relevant but somewhat obvious or common choices.
    - **4-5 (High)**: Highly Relevant *AND* Highly Unexpected. A true "Hidden Gem" that the user would be pleasantly surprised to discover.
    Given a user's history, rate the serendipity of the candidate movie.
    Generate only the rating (an integer between 1 and 5), and do not include any additional language.
